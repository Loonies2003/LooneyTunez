            <p>Hi, my name is Talhah Loonat and this is my story of how i started to workout and how i have made it my passion and how I would like to inspire people to start working out.</p>
            <p> Ever since i was young, i was always mocked at for being skinny and underweight. People would mock me call me insulting names and this lowered my self-esteem.</p>
            <p>In 2020, due to the lockdown enforced by the Government because of the Corona virus outbreak, I decided to start working out at home with some old dumbells that my brother had.</p>
            <p>I did not know anything about working out, and i would just do random exercises throughout the day hoping that it would make me gain weight. I knew nothing about a healthy diet and bulking.</p> 
            <p>As weeks went by, I started to watch a YouTuber called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/davidlaid/?hl=en" target="_blank" style="color: blue;"> David Laid.</a>He inspired me and to workout everyday and it was through him that I learnt how to bulk and all the different exercises and he showed me that nothing is impossible and that nothing comes to you easy, you have to work for it.</p>
            <p>Whenever I have no motivation to workout anymore, I watch this specific video which inspires me and motivates me alot. I wish to one day, replicate this video and to also inspire others that nothing is impossible.</p>
